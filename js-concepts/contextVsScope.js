// -------------------------- SCOPE -------------------------- //
// - Scope is a function based thing.
// - Scope means what is the variable access of a function when it is invoked.
// - What is the variable environment.

// -------------------------- CONTEXT -------------------------- //
// - Context is more about object based.
// - It refers what is the value of the "THIS" keyword.
// - Which is a reference to the object THAT OWNS, that current executing code.

// ---------------------  TO KEEP IN MIND ---------------------- //
// Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of "THIS" keyword.
// Scope refers to the visibility of variables.
